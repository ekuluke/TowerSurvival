EASY STUFF FIRST; YOU'RE LEARNING TO CODE AND DO ART. DON'T WASTE TIME ATTEMPTING THE HARD IN THE BEGGINING WHEN YOU PROBABLY WON'T GET A 
GOOD RESULT AND BE FORCED TO REFACTOR A LOT.

<Affected people> x (<Joy added> + <Sorrow removed>) / <Time to implement>
Or a simpler version <Increase in sales> / <Time to implement>.

Question mark: For any task that I'll need to think about—either a design question, or how to implement it.
Arrows: For any tasks that are linked in logic or in code. These will likely be implemented at the same time.
Slash: When I have two options that I'll need to choose between, I'll link them with a slash.
Swear words: For anything that I dread and don't want to do. This serves no valid purpose, but it makes me feel good.
